# Corewar

What is it ? Core War is a programming game created by D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney in which two or more battle programs (called "warriors") compete for control of a virtual computer. These battle programs are written in an abstract assembly language.
At the beginning of a game, each battle program is loaded into memory, after which each program executes one instruction simultaneously in a turn. The object of the game is to cause the processes of opposing programs to terminate, leaving the victorious program in sole possession of the machine.
The corewar is a first year project at Epitech.

This project created by a group of 3 students.
